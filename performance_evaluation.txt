Descriptors:
############
AKAZE	~23ms with ~140 matched keypoints from 165 found by detector;
BRIEF	~35ms with ~180 matched keypoints from 280 found by detector;
BRISK	~1.5ms with ~180 matched keypoints from 280 found by detector;
FREAK	~12ms with ~138 matched keypoints from 220 found by detector;
ORB	~1.6ms with ~80 matched keypoints from 125 found by detector;
SIFT	~22ms with ~85 matched keypoints from 135 found by detector;
SURF	~2.3ms with ~155 matched keypoints from 220 found by detector;


All the statistics is above. During the testing the best performance showed the following descriptor-detector pairs:
1. FAST-ORB		DETECTION: ~0.5 ms, ~2690 keypoints detected overall, ~220 keypoints are within the Rect ROI (~50% are out of vehicle boundries), DESCRIPTION: ~0.38ms, MATCHING: ~175 matched keypoints;
2. FAST-BRISK		DETECTION: ~0.5 ms, ~2690 keypoints detected overall, ~220 keypoints are within the Rect ROI (~50% are out of vehicle boundries), DESCRIPTION: ~1.1ms, MATCHING: ~145 matched keypoints;
3. SURF-(ORB)BRISK	DETECTION: ~11.5 ms, ~2940 keypoints detected overall, ~220 keypoints are within the Rect ROI (~50% are out of vehicle boundries), DESCRIPTION: ~1.2ms, MATCHING: ~150 matched keypoints;

Though FAST detector is not that accurate in theory, on practice it shows good results, I wouldn't say that SURF is any better.
ORB and BRISK detectors show almost the same productivity with high processing speed and high TP rate.
